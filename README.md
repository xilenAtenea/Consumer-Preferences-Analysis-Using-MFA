### Data Analytics Subject Activity #1: Implementing AFM to analyze consumer preferences and perceptions of a consumer goods company.
Presented by Angélica Portocarrero and Xilena Atenea Rojas.

This repository contains materials for our first workshop in the Data Analytics course during the seventh semester. The workshop involves analyzing consumer preferences using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA).

#### Files in this Repository
- **Script_AFM_Activity1.R** : This R script contains the code used to perform the MFA analysis.
- **analysis_file.pdf**: This PDF document includes the detailed analysis and case study results.

### Study Context
In this case study, a consumer goods company aims to better understand the preferences and perceptions of its customers regarding its products. To achieve this, data was collected on product characteristics, consumer preferences, and demographic and qualitative information about the consumers. The objective of the analysis is to identify patterns and segment consumers effectively.

### Data Overview
The data used for this analysis includes:
- **Product Quality**: Perceived product quality on a scale of 1 to 10.
- **Product Durability**: Perceived product durability on a scale of 1 to 10.
- **Preference for Taste**: Preference for the taste of the product on a scale of 1 to 10.
- **Preference for Price**: Preference for the price of the product on a scale of 1 to 10.
- **Age**: Age of the consumer in years.
- **Income**: Annual income of the consumer in dollars.
- **Gender**: Gender of the consumer (Male or Female).
- **Education Level**: Education level of the consumer (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, PhD).

### Analysis Objective
The main goal of this analysis is to use MFA to uncover patterns in consumer perceptions of product characteristics and preferences and how these relate to demographic and qualitative data. This will help the company segment consumers and design more effective marketing strategies.
